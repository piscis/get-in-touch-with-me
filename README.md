Get in touch with me
=====================

.. because [contact forms](http://iworx.it/contact) are so web 2.0, .. I decided to provide a different approach for developers 
to contact me, ... and what else is better than sending a pull-request or opening a ticket on Github right?  
  
So if you like to contact me please send me a PR or open a ticket with this project and leave a note how I can 
contact you. There is even a [template](ContactForm.tpl.md) for the pull request you can use.  
  
If you like to know more [me](http://iworx.it/about-me) you can vist my website at: http://iworx.it   
  
Looking forward hearing from you
