Get in touch with me
=====================

.. because contact-forms are so web 2.0, .. I decided to provide a new approach for developers to contact me, and 
what is better than sending a pull-request or open a ticket on Github right?  
  
So if you like to contact me please send me a bull request or open a ticket with this project and leave a note how I can 
contact you.  
  
If you like to know more about me you can vist my website at: http://iworx.it   
  
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
